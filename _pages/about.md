  I'm a third year undergraduate student from College of [Computer and Data Science](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/index.htm),[Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/index.htm).I am currently studying C++ and related aspects of software engineering.Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in programming principles, data structures, and algorithms. Additionally, I have gained hands-on experience through various projects and coursework, which have enhanced my problem-solving skills and understanding of software development processes.

  
  I have developed a deep understanding of dynamic programming and string manipulation. Currently, I am delving into graph theory. My plan is to seek employment after accumulating sufficient professional knowledge and expertise. Additionally, I am continuously working on enhancing my skills through practical projects and advanced coursework to ensure I am well-prepared for the challenges in the software engineering field.
